    \hline
    \textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{Concept} & \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Disadvantages} \\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Power Iteration}  
    & finds the dominant eigen vector and eigen value by repeatedly multiplying A to a random vector and normalising it 
    & Conceptual clarity; Simplicity; Computational efficiency for moderate sizes. 
    & Finds only one eigenpair at a time; Limited numerical accuracy. \\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Jacobi}  
    & Iteratively diagonalizes a symmetric matrix by applying successive rotations to zero out off-diagonal elements. 
    & Accurate for small to medium matrices; Provides all eigenpairs. 
    & Computationally expensive for large matrices; Convergence can be slow. \\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Direct Library - SVD (NumPy)}  
    & Uses optimized, built-in algorithms 
    & Fast, stable, and provides all singular values/vectors directly. 
    & Less educational insight \\
